  ## Description
  CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This is a home work done by a student of Coding Boot Camp - University of Texas at Austin in May, 2022. The work showcases skill learned: MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
